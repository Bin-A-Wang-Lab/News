## Wang's research page

Bin A. Wang, PhD

I'm a Neuropsychologist. I am interested in the neural mechanism underlying prediction-based decision-making processes involved in sensory detection, learning and memory. Combining the functional neuroimaging techniques (fMRI and EEG) and computational modelling, I am investigating how the human brain updates the decision-makings during a probabilistic tactile learning. The roles of frontothalamic interactions is specifically investigated during the decision switching and attentional allocation. These processes are also investigated in disorders, such as schizophrenia, where patients often focus on highly unlikely interpretations of their incoming sensory inputs impairing their overall attentional allocation and decision making abilities. 

I am also interested in how Acetylcholine and Dopamine differentially regulate the integration of sensory perception and expectations during inference and learning by modulating the recurrent information flow within a hierarchy network. State-dependent effects of reward and punishment and the pharmacological effects on these processes will also be studied.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/binwang87828/Bin-A-Wang-lab.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/binwang87828/Bin-A-Wang-lab.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
